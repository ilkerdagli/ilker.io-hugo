Hello and welcome to my personal blog! My name is Ilker Dagli, and I'm a Sr. Devops Engineer at Near East University in North Cyprus. I have a degree in Computer Engineering and a passion for all things technology-related. I'm fluent in Turkish, Arabic, and English, and I love attending conferences and staying up-to-date on the latest trends in the industry.

In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects that allow me to explore new technologies and develop my skills.

I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you through this blog, and I hope you find it informative and enjoyable. Thanks for visiting!
